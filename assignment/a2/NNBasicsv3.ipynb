    "### Brief Review of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, parametric models are those where the model is a function of a fixed form with a number of unknown _parameters_.  Together with a loss function and a training set, an optimizer can select parameters to minimize the loss with respect to the training set.  Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent.  It tweaks the parameters slightly to move the loss \"downhill\" due to a small batch of examples from the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A:  Linear & Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "You've likely seen linear regression before.  In linear regression, we fit a line (technically, hyperplane) that predicts a target variable, $y$, based on some features $x$.  The form of this model is affine (even if we call it \"linear\"):  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{hat} = xW + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ and $b$ are weights and an offset, respectively, and are the parameters of this parametric model.  The loss function that the optimizer uses to fit these parameters is the squared error ($||\\cdots||_2$) between the prediction and the ground truth in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've also likely seen logistic regression, which is tightly related to linear regression.  Logistic regression also fits a line - this time separating the positive and negative examples of a binary classifier.  The form of this model is similar: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{hat} = \\sigma(xW + b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where again $W$ and $b$ are the parameters of this model, and $\\sigma$ is the [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) which maps un-normalized scores (\"logits\") to values $\\hat{y} \\in [0,1]$ that represent probabilities. The loss function that the optimizer uses to fit these parameters is the [cross entropy](../information_theory.ipynb) between the prediction and the ground truth in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern of an affine transform, $xW + b$, occurs over and over in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We'll use logistic regression as our running example for the rest of this part.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short Answer Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to implement logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `z = xW + b`\n",
    "* `y_hat = sigmoid(z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "1.  `x` is a 10-dimensional feature vector\n",
    "2.  `W` is the weight vector\n",
    "3.  `b` is the bias term\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the dimensions of `W` and `b`?  Recall that in logistic regression, `z` is just a scalar (commonly referred to as the \"logit\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Sketch a picture of the whole equation using rectangles to illustrate the dimensions of `x`, `W`, and `b`.  See examples below for inspiration (though please label each dimension).  We don't ask you to submit this, but make sure you can do it!  It's the \"print\" debugging statement of neural networks!  It's also useful for reading papers... if you can't draw the shapes of all the tensors, you don't (yet) know what's going on!"

    "## Part B: Batching\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to perform inference using your model (parameters `W` and `b`) above on 10 examples intsead of just 1. On modern hardware (especially GPUs), we can do this efficiently by *batching*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we stack up the feature vectors in x like in the diagram below.  Note that changing the number of examples you run on (i.e. your batch size) *does not* affect the number of parameters in your model.  You're just running the same thing in parallel (instead of running the above one feature vector at a time at a time).\n",
